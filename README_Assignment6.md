# Assignment 6: Medians and Order Statistics & Elementary Data Structures

## Overview
This project implements and analyzes two selection algorithms, **Median of Medians** and **Randomized Quickselect**, for finding the k-th smallest element in an unsorted array. Additionally, it explores and implements basic data structures such as arrays, stacks, queues, and singly linked lists. Time complexity and performance analyses are also provided, comparing the efficiency of different data structures and algorithms.

## Project Structure
1. **Selection Algorithms**:
   - Median of Medians (Deterministic)
   - Randomized Quickselect (Expected Time Complexity)

2. **Elementary Data Structures**:
   - Arrays
   - Stacks
   - Queues
   - Singly Linked Lists

## Performance Analysis
- Detailed analysis of time complexity for each algorithm and data structure operation.
- Empirical performance comparison of **Median of Medians** and **Randomized Quickselect** with graphical performance comparison for different input sizes and distributions.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```
   cd <project_directory>
   ```
3. Run the Python scripts for each part of the assignment to observe the results:
   ```
   python selection_algorithms.py
   python data_structures.py
   ```

## Practical Applications
- **Arrays**: Ideal for quick access to elements and static data.
- **Stacks**: Used in expression evaluation, undo/redo operations, and DFS.
- **Queues**: Useful for task scheduling, BFS in graphs, and request handling.
- **Singly Linked Lists**: Best for dynamic memory allocation and real-time applications.

## Conclusion
This project compares two selection algorithms and implements basic data structures to analyze their performance in various scenarios. It provides insights into the trade-offs between different data structures and their use in real-world applications.
